"""
PHASE A heartbeat (E, worker-side): gpu_worker.py's _HeartbeatPulse thread
must actually call the heartbeat function periodically while running, and
must stop promptly (not just "eventually") when stopped — so it can never
outlive process_job()'s try/finally around a mode run.

WORKER_BACKEND_MODE is left at its "db" default (see conftest.py's own env
setup) so gpu_worker imports scripts.prod_job_store — that import is
patched out entirely here (touch_job_heartbeat replaced with a recording
stub) so this test needs no DB either.
