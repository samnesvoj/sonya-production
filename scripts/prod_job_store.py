prod_job_store.py
=================
PostgreSQL job store for SONYA generation pipeline.

Tables (from migrations):
  generation_jobs  — job lifecycle
  generation_files — per-job S3 file registry

Status lifecycle:
  queued → claimed → downloading → model_downloading → mode_running
  → analyzing → yolo → scripting → tts → subtitles → assembling
  → uploading_result → completed
  (any step) → failed

Functions:
  create_job             create a new queued job
  create_job_idempotent  atomic create-or-detect-conflict insert
                         (POST /api/generation/jobs Idempotency-Key,
                         migration 009)
  get_job_by_idempotency_key  fetch the job owning a (user_id, key) pair
  create_job_with_quota  idempotency-key check + free-plan quota reservation
                         + job insert, all in one transaction (see its own
                         docstring -- this is what create_generation_job()
                         and _run_url_ingest() call; create_job_idempotent()
                         above is kept for other callers/tooling but is no
                         longer on the free-plan-gated path)
  get_job                fetch single job by id
  list_user_jobs         paginated list for a user
  update_job_status      granular status update (any status constant)
  complete_job           mark completed, set output key + metadata
  fail_job               mark failed, optionally requeue as queued
  claim_next_pending_job FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED — poll mode
  claim_specific_job     claim a known job_id — --once mode
  requeue_stale_jobs     reset stuck jobs → queued (liveness-aware — see
                         touch_job_heartbeat below)
  touch_job_heartbeat    refresh heartbeat_at only (migration 011) — proves
                         a worker is still alive on a long-running job
                         without touching status/updated_at; called
                         periodically by gpu_worker.py during a long mode
                         run (e.g. streamer's multi-hour enrichment)
  add_job_file           register an S3 file with a job
  list_job_files         list all files for a job

Streamer batches (migration 012) — batch foundation only, no HTTP
endpoints and no worker phase dispatch wired up yet:
  create_streamer_batch          new batch, analysis_job_id nullable
  get_streamer_batch             user_id required — ownership enforced in the query
  list_user_streamer_batches     paginated list for a user
  set_streamer_batch_status      terminal-status transitions are locked (see its docstring)
  attach_analysis_job_to_batch   set analysis_job_id once the generation job exists
  replace_streamer_segments      atomic delete-all + insert for one batch
  list_streamer_segments         ordered by ordinal
  set_streamer_segment_selection toggle one segment's `selected`
  attach_streamer_clip_job       link a real generation_jobs row to a segment (idempotent)
  list_streamer_clip_jobs        all clip-job links for a batch
  segments_from_analysis         maps analyze()'s return shape -> replace_streamer_segments() input

GPU dispatcher / Vast startup SLA (migration 006 + 007):
  get_stale_gpu_requested_jobs  find jobs stuck past VAST_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SEC
  mark_gpu_startup_timeout      requeue (another offer) or fail a timed-out job

GPU instance ownership / cleanup (future automatic lifecycle — see
gpu_orchestrator.cleanup_instance_for_terminal_job and
gpu_dispatcher.reconcile_gpu_instance_cleanup; disabled today because the
current production GPU is manually managed, not dispatcher-provisioned):
  get_ephemeral_contract_id           contract_id to destroy for a terminal
                                       job, or None if not a dispatcher-owned
                                       instance
  mark_gpu_instance_cleanup_destroyed record a confirmed destroy (incl. 404)
  mark_gpu_instance_cleanup_error     record a failed destroy attempt
  get_terminal_jobs_pending_gpu_cleanup
                                       dispatcher reconciliation candidates —
                                       terminal + vast_ephemeral + not yet
                                       confirmed destroyed

    detection is entirely the database's, via the unique index

    not protect against two concurrent requests racing past it.

    Deliberately does NOT use ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE -- generation_jobs
    has a BEFORE UPDATE trigger (trg_jobs_updated_at) that would bump
    updated_at on the existing row for every duplicate/replayed request,

    "spent" quota unit behind, and a replayed request never spends quota
    a second time.

    create_job_idempotent's separate-connection unique-index-race pattern
    (which is safe for uniqueness alone, but not for "check quota, then
    decide whether to spend it" without also serializing per user). The
    actual expensive work (download/S3 upload) happens entirely before this
    function is called -- this transaction only ever does two small
    SELECTs, at most one UPDATE, and one INSERT.

    If the job insert fails for any reason (unique-constraint violation
    from a bug elsewhere, connection loss, etc.), the whole transaction
    rolls back -- including the quota UPDATE above it in the same
    transaction -- so free_video_used is never incremented for a job that

    Create a new batch, optionally already pointed at an analysis job.
    analysis_job_id is nullable by design (migration 012): a batch exists
    from the start of ingest, before the analysis generation_jobs row
    necessarily exists yet — see attach_analysis_job_to_batch() for
    attaching it once it does.

    idempotency_key (migration 014) makes batch creation itself idempotent:
    a double-click or network retry on POST /api/streamer/batches with the
    SAME (user_id, idempotency_key) must not create a second batch (and,
    downstream, must not charge Free-plan quota twice). Enforced via an
    atomic INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (user_id, idempotency_key) DO NOTHING —
    exact same pattern as create_job_idempotent() (migration 009) — not a
    SELECT-then-INSERT, so two truly concurrent requests with the same key
    still resolve to exactly one row. idempotency_key=None (no header —
    legacy behavior) never conflicts with anything: NULL is distinct from
    every other NULL under PostgreSQL UNIQUE semantics, so this is a no-op
    change for every existing caller that doesn't pass it.

    The returned dict carries one extra, non-persisted key —
    "_created_now": True when this call's own INSERT won (a genuinely new
    batch), False when it returned a pre-existing row instead. The caller
    (POST /api/streamer/batches) uses this to decide whether to proceed
    with ingest/quota at all, or short-circuit and return the existing
    batch's current state untouched.

    Update a batch's status. Minimal transition guard only, not a state-
    machine framework: once a batch is in a terminal status (ready /

    generating both raise StreamerBatchTransitionError. Setting the SAME
    terminal status again is a no-op success (idempotent replay), not an
    error. No ordering/forward-flow validation beyond that — any
    non-terminal -> any status is allowed, same looseness
    update_job_status() already has for generation_jobs.

    There is no existing "transition validation" layer anywhere in this
    codebase to place this above instead — update_job_status() for
    generation_jobs is a plain unconditional UPDATE, legality enforced
    purely by which callers invoke it in what order. This is a new,
    deliberately minimal rule specific to batches, living in the store
    layer because no batch API layer exists yet to put it in instead.

    The guard is enforced by the UPDATE's own WHERE clause (status <>
    ALL(terminal_statuses) OR status = the new status), NOT by a separate
    SELECT-then-UPDATE — a check-then-write here would leave a window for
    a second, concurrent call to slip a real transition through between
    the read and the write. The single statement is atomic: Postgres
    evaluates WHERE against the row as it stands at that instant, so two
    concurrent set_streamer_batch_status() calls on the same terminal
    batch can never both "win" — at most one row-affecting UPDATE happens,
    same guarantee create_job_with_quota's ON CONFLICT already relies on
    elsewhere in this file, just via WHERE instead of a unique index. The
    follow-up SELECT below only ever runs to build a clear error message
    after the UPDATE already found 0 rows to touch — it never decides
    whether the mutation happens.

    Shared by both gpu_worker.py backend modes: the "db" worker calls this
    directly (see _db_submit_streamer_segments), and the "api" worker
    reaches it indirectly via POST /api/worker/streamer/batches/{id}/
    analysis-result (scripts/streamer_routes.py), which just calls this
    same function server-side.

    Idempotent under retry: the analyze job's OWN generation_jobs row can
    be retried by the dispatcher after a TRANSIENT failure in a step that
    runs AFTER segments were already successfully persisted here (e.g. the
    analysis-manifest S3 upload in gpu_worker.py's
    _finish_streamer_analyze_job — see retry=True there) — re-running
    analyze() and calling this function a second time for the SAME batch
    must NOT delete and re-insert segments with fresh UUIDs: that would
    invalidate anything the frontend already rendered/cached, and could
    turn an in-flight POST .../selection (using the first call's segment
    ids) into a spurious "foreign_segment" rejection. So: if this batch
    already has segments, this call is a no-op that returns them
    unchanged -- first-call-wins, not last-call-wins. Locks the batch row
    (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) before checking, so two genuinely concurrent
    submits for the same batch_id serialize here instead of both reading
    "no segments yet" and both inserting.

    Does NOT use replace_streamer_segments() (that function is an
    unconditional force-replace, still used/tested as its own primitive
    elsewhere) -- this is a separate, narrower "insert once" contract.

    Deliberately does NOT touch analysis_job_id (already attached at
    batch-creation time — see attach_analysis_job_to_batch()) or the
    analysis generation_jobs row's own status (the caller still reports
    that job's own completion through the normal worker/complete flow,
    separately — this function is purely about the batch and its
    segments).

def reconcile_streamer_batch(batch_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Defensive batch-status reconciliation from its compose (streamer_clip_
    jobs) generation_jobs' current statuses. Called from two places: right
    after a compose job's worker/complete or worker/fail endpoint runs
    (the primary trigger), and defensively from GET /api/streamer/batches/
    {id} in case that hook was ever missed (worker crash between its own
    /complete call and this reconciliation, process restart, etc).

    No-op (returns the batch as-is) if:
      - the batch doesn't exist (returns None)
      - the batch is already terminal (ready/partially_failed/failed/
        cancelled) — reconciliation never re-opens a settled batch
      - the batch has no streamer_clip_jobs yet (still awaiting_selection
        or earlier — nothing to reconcile)
      - at least one attached clip job's generation_jobs row is still
        non-terminal (queued/claimed/...) — batch stays "generating",
        no status write happens at all (idempotent no-op, not even a
        same-status UPDATE)

    Once every attached clip job has reached a terminal generation_jobs
    status (completed/failed/cancelled):
      - all completed                       -> ready
      - none completed (all failed/cancelled) -> failed
